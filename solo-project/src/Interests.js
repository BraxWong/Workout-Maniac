            <p className="interests_des">I have a lot of interests. I pretty much workout everyday with the exception of having Sunday as a restday. I have also been playing tennis for the past 4 years. Even though I am not making as much progress as I hope I would but its fun. I also love to read and prepare dinner for my family. And coding is also my passion. Hoping when I am out of college I will be able to get a well-paid software engineerer job.</p>
