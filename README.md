# Workout Maniac (Web Development Tutorial In Disguise)
Welcome to Workout Maniac my fellow gym rats! My name is Brax and I am a computer science student at the University of Nottingham. I just finished my freshman year and have nothing to do. So I decided to dig a little deeper into web developement as I find that more interesting. 

In the main page, you will find my workout plan, including Back, Chest, Leg, and even Rest Days. You can click on learn more on the respecive section to find out more about what I will do on that particular day. It will most likely include a video on how to perform the exercise safely and effectively. It will also be recoring my current PB and possibly my fitness goals in the future, who knows!

I have included a login page which does absolutely nothing at the moment. I will try to expand the website as I am going through the web development tutorial.

The video that I am currently following through is called "Web Development Full Course - 22 Hour Course | Learn Full Stack Web Development From Scratch". This is a fantastic video made by a youtube channel called codedamn. It is really easy to understand the concepts. So I recommend you checking it out if you are a beginner.
