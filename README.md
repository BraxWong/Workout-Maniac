# Workout Maniac (Web Development Tutorial In Disguise)
Welcome to Workout Maniac my fellow gym rats! My name is Brax and I am a computer science student at the University of Nottingham. I just finished my freshman year and have nothing to do. So I decided to dig a little deeper into web developement as I find that more interesting. 

In the main page, you will find my workout plan, including Back, Chest, Leg, and even Rest Days. You can click on learn more on the respecive section to find out more about what I will do on that particular day. It will most likely include a video on how to perform the exercise safely and effectively. It will also be recoring my current PB and possibly my fitness goals in the future, who knows!

You will also find a BMI and Body Fat Percentage calculator. 

# BMI Calculator

This section introduces you to the idea of Body Mass Index and teaches you how to calculate it by hand. It will explain the formula in an easy manner so everyone can understand it.

This section will allow you to input your height(in CM) and weight(in KG), after pressing the **calculate BMI** button, it will automatically calculate your BMI and print it out on the screen. There is also a bar at the bottom, indicating whether you are healthy or not based on the your BMI.

The last section will tell the users who should not be using the BMI calculate since it might cause some confusion if they obtained a result that might lead to hysteria.
